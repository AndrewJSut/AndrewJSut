### Institutional Portfolio Optimization Using FNO Factors + Regime-Based Reinforcement Learning  
A full-stack quantitative research pipeline that develops an institutional-grade multi-asset allocation system.  
We used a **Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)** to extract latent systemic risk factors from cross-sectional fundamentals, built **regime-conditioned MLP factor-premia models**, and optimized portfolio allocation using a **hierarchical reinforcement-learning agent**.

**Highlights:**  
- Extracted latent systemic risk factors using **Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)**  
- Modelled market regimes using:  
  - **FinBERT sentiment scores** from corporate disclosures  
  - **Macro stress index**  
- Derived regime-conditioned factor premia via MLPs  
- Designed a **hierarchical RL allocator** (sector → country → global)  
- Maximized information ratio under institutional constraints:  
  - Turnover limits  
  - Tracking error constraints  
  - Position-size bounds  
- Built full backtesting pipeline + performance attribution
